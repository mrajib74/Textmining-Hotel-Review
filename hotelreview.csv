Treebo Crystal Studio,"Treebo crystal studio is a nice place to stay. Situated in Sakchi, at the third floor, the hotel has good rooms, nicely maintained and spacious. The front office is courteous and helpful. The food is also good only problem is that they have a restaurant outside the hotel premises and hence takes time to deliver.",TravellerAnup,21-Oct-17,5

Treebo KC Manor,Visited KC Manor Treebo for one night. Location is very good. 10 mins from the station and a string of shops on both sides. Initially the room allotted had some smell but they immediately changed the room. We had an early morning checkout so they packed breakfast as it was included in the room. For rate they offered very good stay.,roadtrippingagain,23-Feb-18,3
Treebo KC Manor,"Stayed for 5 nights with my parents. Was a very pleasant stay overall. The room service and response is excellent with very little delay in attending to any requests. The dining and breakfast area is also quite pleasant and breakfast is a worth opt-in since there is nothing much nearby. They have a good enough spread with slight variation every morning. The a-la carte dinner was wonderful too. We had 2 meals and were not disappointed at all. The taste and service were both good.

The only issue we faced was that the drain in the bathroom was not working well. The water kept getting retained on the floor which was super annoying and quite disgusting. Despite making multiple requests, there was no solution to this problem which is totally unacceptable. Please check this aspect before you opt for a room.",SunilSamuel,12-Feb-18,4

Treebo KC Manor,I stayed at KC Manor Jamshedpur on 7.12.2017. In november I stayed at the same hotel in room No 106. That room was good.

The Altira Hotel,"I had booked this hotel in the last week of January for accommodating the guests for a family function. At first very skeptical about the hotel, the first looks impressed me a lot. From then on each process was very heart warming experience. From booking the rooms, to getting the guests accommodated and their Hospitality. A great value for money hotel in the area which never had any hotel in the near vicinity,

Highly Recommended.

A big kudos and thank you to The ALTIRA Hotel staff.",Suman c,13-May-17,5

The Altira Hotel,"Good hotel, bit outskirt from the city, but if you are visiting any of the Tata Offices - then this is the most convenient place to stay. Reception staffing is bit issue but rest is excellent. As of now no restaurants in the hotel & they provide food from their decade old so called Dhaba - which is mouthwatering. KUDOS to all staffs there.",saumen2006,9-Dec-16,4
The Mahal Inn,"This is a pathetic hotel and has abusive staff. I booked this hotel via MMT. The booking was confirmed and payment was made in full. When I arrived at the hotel, they didnot gave me a room saying that the hotel is full. I asked the guy (name is Dev) how this is possible when I have an advanced booking. He said he don't know and asked me to wait and talk to the GM of the hotel. The GM arrived after half an hour and said we cannot give u a room as the hotel is full. I asked him to cancel my booking coz if I cancel my booking then MMT will deduct cancellation charges and he said and I quote ""main ku karoon beh***od, khud kar saale aur bhag ja yahan se koi room nai hai yahan."" I asked him not to use abusive language and speak nicely, and he responeded and I quote ""saale yahin maar dunga beh***od, koi dhoond bhi nahi payega tere ko.""

Motel Madhuban,"Was there for a wedding and the arrangements for hotel and rooms was just below par. no was there to even see that we have drinking water in the rooms, towels in the bathroom, and even show how to switch on the lights of various bulbs in the room/bathroom. The bed sheets were torn, pillow was just flat and filthy. no mode of communication form the room to any outlets. laundry service was pathetic and charges was huge",NirajkumarSinha,11-Apr-17,1
Motel Madhuban,"The hotel is located on a highway, outside Jamshedpur. 

Rooms were ok, but they are definitely too expensive. A/C works properly, while the bathroom is a bit outdated.

At the time of check-out, although we had booked through an international website, we were asked to pay more than the agreed price.

Waiters and staff used to get into the room without even knocking on the door. 

Not recommended.",Matteo F,25-Mar-16,2

This hotel rooms are rarely seen in Goibibo but we can directly contact and get the room booked. I am a regular visitor to this hotel and they provide special discount",Priyamohan72,3-Oct-17,4
JK Residency,"This review is only for Appetite, of JK Residency.

The Food is great and so is the ambiance. Seating arrangements is also quite well planned and appreciative. However, its the service that has disappointed me almost everytime I have been there.

Last time I went there, our waiter goofed up with our order. Part order came, part didn't. Even they were not well informed with the drinks offer that was going on. Needless to say, even the manager didn't agree with the ignorance of the waiter. We had to strongly put our case for them to take a note of it.

Such service is not appreciable from a restaurant who boasts of such stature. Rest all, as I mentioned earlier, regarding the food and all was very appreciable.",Samayak M,3-Jun-17,3
JK Residency,I mostly prefer staying at this hotel during my trips to the city. Location wise it's very approachable and provides a comfortable stay with good food. Only negative point I found is that they don't have all English channel's subscription for their TV.,Mudit M,20-Nov-16,4

Ginger Hotel Jamshedpur,"I can't help myself from falling in love with everything in this hotel.There isn't single negative-point that I could say about Ginger Hotel @ Jamshedpur.



I liked everyone in Ginger Hotel @ Jamshedpur.  

One of the greatest gifts you can give to anyone is the gift of attention. 

I had a chance to meet with Dipankar, who is working as a wait-stuff. His is attentive, fast, pleasant, unobtrusive. My wife don't like spicy food. With the help of Dipankar and his chef, my wife was able to eat all different kinds of food @ Ginger. And I must confess, Ginger's chef is one of the best chef in Jamshedpur. As they are capable to prepare tasty & delicious food, even-though it wasn't too spicy. I would like to say thanks and appreciate to Dipankar!!! Keep it up!!!


Everyone at Ginger hotel were so good, helpful, friendly, humble and laborious. If I need to stay @ Jamshedpur, then I will stay in Ginger. I would like to appreciate Surbhi and Rumana for their effort and good work.",abhi8812,2-Apr-18,5

It offers almost all the amenities and facilities one looks for, and some are available on asking or sharing (such as newspaper in the lobby, iron board on each floor). But the comfort, cleanliness and service are excellent. Modest breakfast and dinner layout, but considering the buffet charge (breakfast comes free with the room), it's certainly good enough.

The Weekend,"A beautiful place to spend two nights . Homely atmosphere, spic n span rooms and toilets which we all require during travel to anywhere. Toileteries in the room simply awesome in the price tag. People are courteous . Only five cottages but that is my point oif view is absolutely O.K.More people , off course more business but more noise too. The authority is very choosy about the occupants and they do not allow generally young people or young couple . That is good or bad is different issue but acceptable to me. As this place is in the amidst of nature so to maintain the serenity is important. One point I did inform to the host that breakfast with sandwich is not that good in terms of quantity . They told me that whether I did ask for more or not. Yes none of us did ask for sure but at the same time it could have been asked from the part of the owner. As a result , on the departure date we wanted to know that Puri /Sabji can be had if requires . They politely said 'Yes"".If not then we were ready to pay more for extra. This is not a complaint but little professionalism could have been more enjoyable. At last , a great stay",Somnanth B,21-Aug-17,4
The Weekend,"This place is well situated away from the city, surrounded by natural beauty from all sides. Lush greenery is maintained inside the resort. The resort boasts of a small pond, where fishing can be done, but on prior request, but on a catch and release basis.
They also carry out farming of vegetables in their garden space. Apart from the cozy cottages, there are many spots to just laze about and enjoy nature. 
The food served by the staff is very delicious. Must try is the 'desi chicken'. The host and staff are very friendly, but have a set of norms for their visitors, which is very appreciable. This place is only meant for families, as maintained by the host. 
Also, for a bird-watcher like me, one would find plenty of winged species flying in and around the resort",Samayak M,11-Jul-17,5
The Weekend,"We went to The Weekend Resort last weekend and in one word the stay at this resort was awesome.The resort is exceptionally well maintained.There are 5 AC cottages and the rooms are also very well maintained with LED TV in the room (though we didn't turn it on :) ) and geyser in the bathroom.They provide wide range of toiletries.

In this resort they do organic farming and if you walk around the resort you'll get to see plenty of vegetables, fruits and flowers.Whatever food (except fish/chicken) we ordered it was picked from the garden and then cooked.The taste of the food was awesome.

If you have kids along with you, they will enjoy the place like anything.

This is such a peaceful place that it will surely rejuvenate your mind.There are few places which you can go explore from here. 3 kilometers away there is a place called Paharbhanga which can be explored in early morning.Its better to avoid this place after 10 am as it gets hot.One can also go to Dimna lake and Jubilee park in Tatanagar which is around 22-25 kms.The hotel people advised us not to go to Dimna lake after sunset and we abided by it.They were very helpful and showed great hospitality.

If you are a drinker you need to carry your booze.You will not find anything outside this resort.You can also order Mahua and their staff will bring it for you.

I would also like to do a special mention of their staff ""Gobindo"" who was very nice.This guy does his work happily and will always ensure that you are comfortable and enjoying every bit of your stay in this resort without any trouble.

The only negative thing that i found was that few food items (like Duck,Mutton) were a bit expensive.",Sandipta P,8-Mar-17,4

Yellow Tree,"The place is wrongly called a hotel whereas it is more like a guest house. The rooms are spacious and comfortable but does not have much to offer in menu. They do have a kitchen but it seems to function only for breakfast. Usually all food is brought from an adjoining restaurant, which is horrible. ",Neeraj S,3-Jan-18,3
Yellow Tree,Poor service ...... charged 4000 rs for basic room... not having proper toiletries... gyser was not working prpoerly... its a hotel made in apartment... dinning options are limited..food quality is good... lift not working... no bell boy carried luggage to 2nd floor. One can easili find better ones at jamshedpur at this cost.,Maniis a,27-Dec-17,1

Yellow Tree,"I had an opportunity to visit Jamshedpur for a official visit however got my self booked at this hotel which is located in a building and transformed the apartments into hotel rooms and it""s a family managed apartment/guest house which offers friendly service however this place does not have their own proper kitchen at all and offers limited variety of breakfast in their small pantry however the rooms are elegantly designed and offers descent service however they are dozens of better hotels in Jamshedpur than this for the price that they charge overall no big complains but certainly not worth more than rupees 2000 if they charge more than pls look for other suitable options which is not a challenge in a city like Jamshedpur.",manish_mehta,23-Dec-16,3
Yellow Tree,"I booked with a reference and after talking to Mr prashant I was assured of room after reaching late and without prior payment.
I was upgraded to suite rooms.
Rooms were very nicely done above star class.
Reception and staff are always at service with smile.
Swift check in swift late check out.
We had a in house meeting with outside guests but they were pleasently attended.
I m very happy with their effort and 3 days stay at jamshedpur.
I strongly recommend yellow tree.

BS Plaza,"Hotel B S PLAZA located in the Bistupur area is a good property. I stayed in last November for one night stay. The rooms are large. There is a roof top restaurant. The breakfast was complimentary and was of good Quality. The hotel tariff is also reasonable.

Would recommend to colleagues and friends for the next official tour in Jamshedpur.",tty70,29-Jan-18,4
BS Plaza,The Hotel is reasonably comfortable for a business traveller and offers complimentary breakfast which has a reasonable spread. It is centrally located and accessibility is not an issue. The only issue is that the glass panes are not sound proof and hence you may have to bear with the traffic noise in the morning.,GVBOSS,1-Dec-17,4
BS Plaza,"Have stayed here about 2 years ago, the place was much clean, staff was much courteous, hospitality was very good. Most importantly cleanliness was much better. But in last visit felt perhaps mangement has been changed etc, as hospitality have reduced, overall breakfast quality is pathetic.
They definitely need to work around the same, it was one of good budget luxury places in Jamshedpur, it has been reduced to mere Mediocre place",shs07,17-Aug-17,3
BS Plaza,The hotel is located on the main road and very near to the market so don't expect a view from the window. You will be greeted to smoking chimney and coal dumps. There is a dirty smell in the corridor and lobby and I found the stay very depressing. The TV does not work half the time and good luck finding any decent channel. The breakfast is half decent and unappealing (don't know if it was the smell). The toilet was clean but a little cramped. Overall I wouldn't think of staying there next time.,amandeep118,7-Aug-17,1

BS Plaza,"I have been visiting this hotel from last 3 years. I have stayed at this hotel and have ordered food from the in house restaurant. I admire the friendly hotel staff, starting from the reception to kitchen. The courtesy and the friendliness of all the hotel employees has always touched me. Tandoori Chicken is the my favorite. The rooms are moderate; however, the service is very much comfortable and appreciable. Well located in Bistupur with almost all kind of required services. Laundry service is very much limited and hence i would advise to check the timings for the same. Overall, It was a memorable experience since the very first time.",adirups,24-Mar-16,5
BS Plaza,"I have stayed twice at BS park plaza and visited couple of occasions for lunch or dinner parties. At bistupur, the main market place of jamshedpur. Always delighted with the services and food. Parking space is not enough, however in my view that is not a constraint. You may visit here for wining and dining. Highly recommended",raj74,5-Oct-17,5
BS Plaza,"Jamshedpur has very few mid range hotels. They are too costly as the tax itself is 20 % of the room rent. apart from this hotel,there is Natraj and Bouleward hotel . Both of them don?t have elevators. So we had no choice but to book this one. They took the booking over the phone. No advance payment was required. the location is perfect. The rooms are nice, spacious, neat and clean. There is a geyser fitted to the bath. So no worries about round the clock hot water supply. Our geyser did not function properly on the 2nd day. They rectified it immediately. Breakfast was good. The problems we faced during our stay are.: 1.We had hired an extra bed (Rs 800+).they just dropped a mattress on the freezing cold floor.Thats it!. they did not have the portable cot. They don?t offer complimentary breakfast for children. its not included in this extra bed charge also.
2. the lobby was terribly smelly.
3. doors were jammed.the handle came with our hand.
4. its on the main road- around 2.00 am there was some lorry that was kept in reverse gear (for more than 30min). The loud beep noise was so annoying. I couldn?t sleep anymore.",travelsome4,28-Jan-16,3
Nalanda Hotel,"Although it is quite an old Hotel it has lost its charm in face of new competitors. What I did not like was that they gave me a standard room and while checking out they were billing me a deluxe room.

Staffs are courteous. Luxary room are good. Infrastructure looks old but maintained properly. Toilet & bed sheets were clean. They will provide shampoo pouch & soap.
Food are ok through it is bit costly. Average cost for veg dinner will be around Rs 300. If you are planning to catch a train in the morning ,better to settle payment after dinner else it will take 10-15 min. Auto`s are easily available in front of hotel. Settle Auto is also available. Distance from hotel to Tatanagar station is around 3 km & auto will charge Rs 60-80.",anjy37,22-Feb-16,4

Golden Leaf Resort,"We were a team of 18 people, including 5 kids, travelling from Kolkata and had booked for 2 nights at the Golden Leaf Resort during Holi. We reached Jamshedpur early in the morning around 4:00 AM and the resort manager was helpful enough to allow for an early-checkin. The deluxe rooms were very good - clean and spacious with attached balcony. Room service was very efficient. 
Breakfast was complimentary and served in the restaurant- The Woods. Normally, there was bread, eggs, puri sabji, cornflakes, idli/alu paratha, juices, tea/coffee available for breakfast. 
The resort had a nice lawn which was decorated during the Holi day. Our team had a good time playing with colors. There was also a small children park to keep the kids busy. Special lunch thali @499 was served on the Holi afternoon in the lawn. The taste of the items was good but the quantity was very little. In the evening, we had starters specially the Pahari chicken which was too good. Food was tasty but expensive. The service was good though, we were served ice creams even though we ordered them pretty late at night.

Overall a well-maintained resort, to enjoy a couple of days in the lap of nature.",Tamalika M,17-Mar-18,4
Golden Leaf Resort,"Nestled in the lush green foothills of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, this is a perfect weekend getaway resort. It takes approx 4 hours to reach Jamshedpur by train from Kolkata. From station the resort is almost 18 kms away at the fringe of Jamshedpur city. You get close touch with nature yet the convenience of a city. The resort is very well planned. The staff are courteous and food is great. The service quality though good is a bit slow. However if you plan to just laze away your weekend in Nature's lap after a hectic life in city, this is as good as it gets. Tip: Book through online portals who give heavy discounts which even direct booking at hotel cannot match. Do homework before hand.",sk532,5-Oct-17,4

Golden Leaf Resort,"We had booked for two nights, and had plans of travelling with parents. The pictures seemed nice, and even though some reviews here warns you of shoddy customer service, we thought of taking a chance. Well, after booking through booking.com I tried calling the mobile number multiple times, but no one picks up the phone! Then I called the landline number (you can find it in justdial). Well, someone picks up if you are really persistent (say after every 5th or 6th attempt). But till date they just couldn't confirm our booking. Every time we called they said they will call back, which they don't, and then when you call them, the response is again the same. 
I shudder to think the service we would get during the stay if they can't confirm the booking for the last 10 days. It would be too much of a risk if they turned us down when we land there with our parents! So we went ahead and booked another hotel (KC manor) who was able to confirm the booking the very first time I called. 
Thank God, for free cancellation policies!! Small mercies!",Sayani_Wanderlust,9-Sep-17,1

Restaurant has very few dishes.Service is late & a wake up call request in the morning is completely forgotten.
The only plus point is the staff's courteous behaviour.
Location wise it is in the interior of Bistupur, & difficult to access the main Bistupur market.

The Boulevard Hotel,"Have been staying here since Feb 2016 and still I find this hotel very appealing because of the simplistic ambience as far as the rooms and other services are concerned. This time too it wasn't an exception. The staff are intriguingly funny, inquisitive and courteous. But sometimes the simplicity lays bare some of the essentials that need to be taken care of like malfunctioning air-conditioners and television sets. The prices at Chopsticks I felt are a bit too over expensive compared to what is available outside. The hotel management can have their reasons but perhaps keeping the prices low could attract more customers as they can refrain from going elsewhere. Rest is okay. And that includes the Brubeck Bakery that continues to be as stunningly alluring as it was last December for the variety of sandwiches and pizzas it sells at great prices.

The Boulevard Hotel,"Every year special food festivals are held at the Chopsticks Restaurant of Hotel Boulevard, and this year was no different. While most major restaurants in Jamshedpur hold Bengali Food Festivals duirng the Bengali New Year period, the popularity of such festivals depend not just on the publicised long list of menu items, but more importantly on the authenticity of Bengali flavours. 

On this last and most important criterion I found Chopsticks to score heavily over its other peers. For a true Bengali food connosieur a sure shot ""put-off"" is to discover a Punjabi flavour in the much touted ""Dhokar Dalna"" or Echorer Dalna"" - a mandatory listing on any Bengali speciality menu. Unfortunately, many of the restaurants take the easy shortcut to use their base Punjabi gravy to garnish these so called Bengali dishes and make a mess of their pretensions of offering authentic Bengali fare.

While the vegetarian menu during the Bengali Food festival at Chopsticks was not only authentic but also as near as possible to grandma""s standards of tasty Bengali cooking. Even the Begun Bhaja and Chholaar daal were of the lip smacking variety. 

Not to be left behind, the fish dishes were a real revelation as far as the sizes of the fishes were concerned, backed uop with real fine cooking. It was clear that that ""Paabda"" fish was specailly brought from the premier Kolkata markets, instead of compromising with the smaller specimens available locally. The Hilsa dish was also well prepared, but to be honest, the out of season Hilsa really could not contribute much to the overall tastiness of the dish. The mutton in the ""Kosha Mangso"" was indeed tender and provided just the contrasting blend to supplement the fish dishes.

Due thoughtfulness was shown in the dessert items too, and special mention needs to be made of the mango chutney - an absolute must for a summer menu, and the ""payesh"" to round off a truly satisfying ""Bangali Bhoj""

Last but not the least, a comparison of the rates charged makes the Chopstick fare a hugely superior value for money, added with the convenience of being offered a choice between a la carte; buffet and ""thaali"" options",pkghosh,22-Apr-17,4
The Boulevard Hotel,"A short stopover for lunch at Chopsticks was a pleasant surprise for the sheer VFM.

The Boulevard Hotel,"This hotel board say it was established in 1945. Indeed the architecture and furniture stand testimony to this claim. It appears that they have,however made some attempts in the past to upgrade though in bits and pieces. The result is a mixture of the reminiscences of a colonial heritage and the later on added amenities like window AC. Have stayed here a number of times in the past three years. Its located right at the heart of Bistupur. The rooms are clean and the food is not bad. However the menu is limited. Earlier they had a complimentary buffet breakfast served on the balcony of a meeting hall but last week when I was there for a day I found that missing. Also earlier there was a bar but not now.

Hotel Jiva,"I spent 2 nights in the Hotel during my recent visit to this city on a business tour. I wasnt expecting much from hotels there being a small city but, the Room I stayed was no less than a 4 Star Property room in Delhi.
All modern amenities, Good Wi-fi, decent Bar, reasonable Charges and good Service. To top your stay they served good Breakfast. 
100% recommended for people looking for a business hotel in Jamshedpur. 
Only drawback is their location being in a crowded market and busy roads.",Rishu J,8-Jul-17,5

Breakfast has a lot of variety & the food is superb.

Hotel Dayal International,"I have always chosen to stay at this hotel as I was comfortable booking it and found the people quite friendly. But for last one year the quality of service has gone down. the restaurant is extremely uncomfortable as it is located underground. The bar-restaurant is worst, as they allow smoking inside the bar-restaurant which is really suffocating. The rooms are congested.",AMOL2153,19-Aug-17,3

Tata Steel Zoological Park is situated in the corner most area of Jubilee Park and is well known for its ""Safari Park"".

Laundry service is A-Class. When you get your clothes back, they looks like new clothes with extremely beautiful packing. Food is also good.
What is bad is the quality of Breakfast they serve. It looks like breakfast and dinner are made in different kitchens, if you see the difference in taste of the food.

Yashwee International,"As most of the better hotels in Jamshedpur were over booked, I booked this hotel on-line, purely going by its name. An officer from Tata Steel, Jamshedpur, who came to drop me at the hotel, had a tough time locating the hotel. I stayed here from 20-23 Nov.
PROS - Fairly large rooms, free wi-fi, complimentary breakfast, passable toiletries; a good touch was a sachet of Almond Drop hair oil.The Hotel has a bar attached; room service is good; food is good and tastefully prepared; breakfast is OK.
CONS - Located in the midst of a bustling market and not very pleasant surroundings; only conveyance from / to the hotel is by share autos (an experience, less said the better); Hotel arranges taxis but are very expensive; Air conditioner was so noisy that it disturbs your sleep. It was more of noise and less of comfortable temperature;",cherry41,24-Nov-17,3
Yashwee International,This is one of the best hotel in Sakchi in Jamshedpur in TATA nagar. The restaurant services were wonderful with plenty of veg & non veg Indian food. The hotel is clean and hospitality of the staff is the most admirable thing.,Rasika K,15-Feb-16,4
Yashwee International,I have visited this place on number of occasion.The ambience will be loved by any sports lover or music lover. The forte for this place is the variety in the items served in this restaurant cum bar. The starters are very delicious. You may try everything on the menu by visiting more than once and I think none of the times you will be disappointed.,Debdatta05,16-Nov-16,4
Yashwee International,"So Vaping is not allowed in the smoking zone. Something that is scientifically 95 % less injurious than smokes. Instead of arguing without fact I would appreciate management to understand what vaping is. We do not vape indoors but outdoors in smoking zone. If one can smoke in smoking zone why not vape?

Vape is vapor and not smoke. It doesn't stink. There is no Passive vaping. The person next to you is not getting killed by vape. Management should take ownership and responsibility of its customers. Apart from food and drinks please understand that we need customer service also. Nice ambiance good food will not be considered good if you cant get good customer service. Please read about vaping. Like smokers there are customers who vape.. Because not everyone knows it I can only suggest you to read a little more allowed it. Please do not turn down the vapers. Smoking Cessation can save many lives. Say no to Smoker not to Vaper.

Kudos to the management for fulfilling a dying person's (smoker's) wish. The manager was arguing instead of understanding. You need to learn to listen",Satyam S,24-Oct-16,1
Yashwee International,"Had stayed at the Yashwee International Hotel for a short business trip. The location is hard to find as it is off the main road. The deluxe room is adequate, comfortable bed and clean linen. There were no issues with the rooms as such. They provide free Wi-fi which is adequate for normal mails and attachments. 
The complimentary breakfast has a limited spread, though the taste is good. They also have a decent sports bar called 60 ml where you can play a round of pool and chill out after hours!
Would certainly visit again.",Kalyan_Roy,29-Jun-16,4
Hotel Balajee,I was looking for few hours stay as had train to catch late in evening so came across this hotel with better ratings on MMT.

No body wish us at the time of arrival. Room was booked by goabibo by Mr. Saif Ahmed. As we are two my ID was not taken after reminding her. She did not offer the choice of room. 208 did not have any sun light. I was looking for duty manager but I couldn't find.",Anand M,16-Nov-17,1
Hotel Sagar,The hotel is located on main road sakchi circle. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The bar is located on basement and very good including the ambience. The rates are reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food given along with drinks. The behavior of the staff including manager was very curtious.,vsyadav65,31-May-17,4
Hotel Sagar,"We had to stay for 3 nights and assumed that the hotel should provide basic facilities. The staff is quite arrogant and in co-operative. They have a set pattern and would not listen to any of your request, I.e., we requested for alloy(potato) + onion curd but since the option was not available in their menu, they could not alter it. Like this many other things were there. The room cleaning in particular was quite pathetic. Despite room cleaning, most walls had lint over it and requesting them repeatedly didn't help much.
Overall the experience was quite poor but since we had to leave early in the morning & come back late we adjusted according to them. 
Will not suggest this hotel for this kind of price",schumyy,5-Mar-17,3

It is extremely well maintained. The entire team, right from the owner is extremely caring and courteous. They will go out of their way to ensure you feel at home.

Even before I reached Jamshedpur, they enquired what I would like to eat and kept it ready for me when I arrived. 

Had amazing conversations with them. You will never get bored, even if you are a solo traveller. Lots to learn from them.

They are expanding and hopefully they will be in a lot more cities soon.",chacks007,12-Aug-17,5

The moment i have enterd this very nicely loacated property near sakchi Gurudwara .i have climb the stairs of fortune seriously my jaws dropped after encountring the front desk .i have never encounterd this kind of property in JAMSHEDPUR from last 2 years of travel.
So i decided to go ahead and book the room for one night stay.( finger crossed) .
The moment i have enterd the room it was a small and cozy room with a queen size bed and a mini fridge. Every thing what ever one needs in buisness travell.
So before wasting time i enterd washroom took shower. Coming out i herd a gental knock i have adrresed . So a very humble guy from the administration standing with a complimentry TEA. And asking about if i need any thing as the moment one gets into the property they add you in a guest group on whats ap .so that every thing and need should be adressed.
He gentally asked if i am planing for dinner.
I just shooked my head and as promised dinner was promising and tasty. 
I intend to stay for 1 night but ended up staying for 7 days.

Pod N Beyond Smart Hotel,"Me along with some of my friends were supposed to stay in Jamshedpur for couple of days and wondering where to stay! That's when my friend who knew the city suggested with Pod N Beyond. We were bit skeptical with this new concept but we said lets give it a try and I am happy that we tried it! Right from arranging transportation from Ranchi to Jamshedpur with arranging the food it was all awesome!

On the first day we had requested for a normal food as we were tired and trust me even though it was just Dal Chawal but was amazing. Ramesh the manager ensured that we got our tea and other things done as and when required. The pods are extremely comfortable and have enough space to keep your luggage and other important documents.

I would recommend this place to all those who would need an excellent place to stay when traveling for business and doesn't burn your pocket. And for those traveling with family can book private pods depending on the number of people traveling.

I wish we start replicating this in other cities!!",Vinay D,11-Apr-17,5

FOOD: food is prepared by with advance order. Taste is amazing and homely.
HOSTITALITY: hospitality is awesome.
TARIFF:super reasonable and pocket friendly.",Khan T,14-Feb-17,5
Pod N Beyond Smart Hotel,"Located diagonally opposite to the Hyundai showroom on the Sakchi road, Pod & Beyond is a small pod concept hotel in Jamshedpur.
This was my first trip to the city and travelling on a budget, this was my choice after going through a lot of hotels (and their reviews) online. I stayed for three nights in the Queen Pod which is a single occupancy room with an en-suite bathroom. The check in and check out was super smooth. Here goes the review ?

Room ? The room is smaller than regular hotel rooms but since it?s a pod themed hotel, so I guess it was justified. Everything was very clean and looked and smelled nice. There?s a split AC which I didn?t need all through my stay. The lighting in the room is alright. Two comfy pillows with spotless linen over a queen size bed with a standard ten-inch mattress, ensured great sleep quality. Ample number of power sockets and light switches within reachable distance (without getting up from the bed), was very thoughtful. There is a reading light too on the bed side. There?s an LCD TV on the wooden partition facing the bed with Airtel DTH connection which played most of the channels I liked. Right below it, is a small yet very convenient table for keeping your day to day things (wallet, glasses etc).
The area on the other side of the partition is like a small dressing room cum study. It has a small table with a chair and an ottoman. Along with that, a mini fridge and a dresser and a spacious wooden wardrobe with some cloth hangers. A bottle of water and emergency light is kept on the table. However, I never experienced a power cut during my stay. There's free Wi-fi too and the coverage and speed were pretty good.

Bathroom - Right after this, we have the bathroom. It?s a decent sized bathroom and I found it perfectly clean and hygienic. There?s a well-functioning geyser too and the bath fittings are shiny new. The amenities included a pair of slippers, a hand wash liquid soap and big bottles of shampoo and body wash from good brands.
Service ? The service was nothing short of pleasant. Right from the front desk to the people serving breakfasts and dinners, everyone was very friendly and always had a smile. It?s a budget hotel and so the staff is limited, but I never found any delay in any of the services (mostly food). All meals are served in a small cute dining area which has an attached kitchen. Makes you feel like you are eating at home. Even the taste of the food is so homely. Simple yet delicious. Every morning I used to get a wake-up knock on the door by the ever so friendly Mr. Rakesh, asking me what I?d like to have for breakfast. In the evenings, Miss Rajni would give me a call on my phone asking me if I?d like to have dinner at the hotel and what would be my food choices. And by the time I got back to my room, the dinner was always ready ? piping hot and yummy.

All these little things add up to make this sweet little hotel a great place to stay. It's well under the budget and has all the amenities of a good hotel. There's no fancy food which in my opinion and for a change, was a good thing. The food is simple and comforting. And just to add a bit more about it, nothing in their small but good enough menu is overpriced. If you are travelling to the city and looking for a great budget hotel, stay here. The Queen Pod is the best of the rooms they offer. Others are mostly small yet comfortable pods which are bunk beds with a little privacy and all the amenities.
It's simple, minimalistic and homely. I'd stay here again on my next trip.",amitsrv,2-Feb-17,5

Hotel Grand,"I booked a double A/C room in this hotel via Clear Trip for 2 guests. When I reached there, they gave me a single room, which was smaller than the size of a bathroom I think. After that, when I argued they put up another cot like thing in the room with a very small blanket kind of thing as mattress. They said this is what is in Standard Room. When I asked to change the room they charged me extra 280 bucks to move me to a room with a double bed. I called up Clear Trip & even they did not help in this.

So, a word of advise please do not book this hotel ever",SourabhRanchi,30-Oct-15,1

I had contacted your mumbai customer care number over phone and told them about it at about 10.30 on the check in day (29.7.2014). But a lady from customer care told you not cannot cancel the booking.perhaps you have a condition that ""AC delux room with complimentary breakfast"" cannot be cancelled. I agree ! but it shall be an AC Delux and not a substandard one. I ask you to make a verification of the condition of the room if you have any doubt.

The Alcor Hotel,"Hotel is centrally located right adjacent to Hotel Ramada. Hotel is built with new modern outlook and design. 

Check in was smooth. As such lobby and rooms are spacious and rooms are equipped with all modern eminities required for a business travellers. Rooms were clean.

The concern. Bathroom had a patchwork on roof which was open from corners /sides. It was right above shower location. See pic attached. Hotel staff could not explain reason for this neither helped to change room as they conveyed hotel is fully booked due to marriages. In this world of modern gadgets it was a security risk as some mischievous person may put some camera at that location and hotel management may not be aware. Hence it is not appreciated on part of hotel to not attend this issue seriously. Family visitors need to be cautious 

Food was good. Breakfast had a good spread. In house bar was also good.",vatsalvardhan,17-Feb-18,3

The staff is quite courteous and you can feel difference as compared to other hotels in the city. The service standards are at par with 4 star hotels in big towns. The irony is not many people stay in the hotel.. Costly as compared to other hotels. Perhaps, people think they will get everything for free in Jamshepur :)
Really enjoyed the hospitality staying here.",vmohanv,16-Feb-18,4
The Alcor Hotel,"Although it s not a 5 start hotel, for all practical purposes it can rival any property in Taj or similar groups. beautifully located off Bistupur, the main market area, the rooms are big and well designed. Amenities are top-class. Restaurants are top notch. Service is fantastic",Jyotirmoy D,6-Feb-18,5
The Alcor Hotel,"I have visited The Alcor a couple of times now. The rooms, ambience, service and amenities are absolutely fabulous. But I must comment on the food, which is truly superb. 

I have eaten at 5-Star hotel chains like the Taj and JW Marriott and I can honestly say that some of the food I've eaten at the Alcor is far better. 

All the cuisines served are authentic and of the highest quality. 

Keep up the fantastic job, I hope to visit again soon.",Nikhil M,10-Dec-17,5
The Alcor Hotel,"Checked into a suite in Alcor...was pleasantly surprised by the size and cleanliness of the room and very large bathroom. Good large LED TVs although it took some servicing to getting them to work properly, but the staff was helpful. Good beds. Split AC in the living room kept dripping water and for the cost and positioning of this hotel they should have had central AC. The breakfast was OK. Overall a good experience specially considering that the other hotels in the city are mostly dated.",dillliwala,7-Dec-17,4

The Alcor Hotel,"Very chic; display of pastry & gelati in the lobby alone was enough to cheer me up, right there! A pleasant casual restaurant with nice breakfast buffet just beyond.

But not cordial or attentive; nor lovable overall. On the 5th floor, we endured too much disco noise pollution from the mezzanine bar, as well as from an adjacent hotel.

Lovely suite room and comfy (hard) bed, though!",LearnedHand,8-Aug-17,4
The Alcor Hotel,"Stayed at Alcor for 2 months for a project. Good place to stay with big rooms, great housekeeping and in-room dining service. Hotel restaurants are also quite good with decent Indian, Oriental, Chinese and Italian options. Staff was really courteous and responsive to the needs.

Issues were with water on 6th and 7th floor where the shower only gives you extremely hot or extremely cold water with low water pressure. Wi-fi is really bad especially after they have installed the new system of login. Also network connectivity in room can be really bad.",SerendipityIndia,7-Aug-17,3
Ramada Jamshedpur,"Stayed at Ramada for a few days, decent hotel, friendly staff, food was good too, smoking rooms are available. 
Things to watch out for - air conditioning can be on the colder side. 
Most irritating was this looouuudd music coming from the 2nd floor, reverberating through the room where the fittings started shaking, extremely vexing. This happened on Saturday night till 12.30 and started up on Sunday at around 2, at the time of writing tia review (4.30) it was still going on.",Ashish S,1-Apr-18,3

But the Bar could do with a little bit of re-stocking.

Ramada Jamshedpur,"Purchased two couple passes for their new year party and it was nothing less than sheer loot. For 6.5 grands a couple, it was quite an exorbitant package and we purchased it assuming it got to be good. However, it was a sheer let down on all counts:
1. We had spoken to the hotel staff before booking and they had mentioned that the new year program involved a Dance troupe and belly dancing by Russian dancers. However, what was finally presented was two foreign dancers on a poorly-designed stage doing some random moves that for sure could not be defined as a ?performance?
2. The arrangement was done in one of their halls (no rooftops or outdoors), stage height was so low that it was impossible for people sitting or standing behind to figure out what was happening on the stage
3. Food was pathetic-bland and tasteless, with only 2 veg and 2 non veg items. Starters were okay though.
4. Drinks on offer at price of the event were below par-if we are paying 6.5 grands, black dog and signature are definitely not worth it-organisers could have gone for a brand of higher standard for sure 
5. This was most shocking-the owner of the property walked in with his entourage and some people in his group started smoking in the family seating area-there was another room for smokers but it seems the owner and his group had no consideration whatsoever for other people in the room
The only saving grace was the DJ who played some foot tapping numbers in general.
All in all, it was a waste of our new year experience, will strongly recommend not to book an event at this property.",VivDelhi,1-Feb-18,1

You literally have to beg them even for the very basic services like drinking water or hot water because of no electricity.

For weddings they just serve you leftover meals the next day, once you have paid the advance you are in their trap and than your nightmare starts. Hotel staff created ruckus on hotel terrace after consuming alcohol. Save yourself some sanity and keep away from this hotel.",amit m,3-Feb-18,1

While asking for further details of our booking on 22/01/2018 , they informed us that they cancelled our booking.

This hotel cancelled our booking without our confirmation. Even they do not bother to inform us by any mail or phone call. They do not provide any apology mail for this while asking for clarification.They also do not bother to refund our advanced money if we did not call on 22/01/2018 for further details. 

The concerned contact person was( Mr. Arup Biswas(Mo:8797598684). The person was totally rude and non-cooperative.

We need to cancel our train booking for this and even we have no option to reschedule any tour for the long weekend(26th-28th Jan 2018) as it was already 22nd Jan 2018( too short time to reschedule).

Even we are facing a lot of harrasment for getting the refund of advanced money. They are delaying the refund with no reason. It is totally frustating.
This service is totally disapponting and disguting. I won't refer anyone to go to 10th Milestone hotel ever.

Hotel Kailash Regency,"An association of many people visited Jamshedpur, Tata for a Satsang. Most of them accomodated in Kailash Residency where the staff showed their pathetic behavior, they were all drunken and beat their customers, very poor service and greedy for money. They dont even have humanity, abused and used bad languages while conversing with the customers, at night they used to drink and also beat a person. Some of the people like Mr Alok Singhania, Harry Singh, Om Prakash, etc had to face this kind of issue. On being beaten by the staff when they tried to call the cops and complain they abused and snatched the phone even.

Apart from that no room service, pathetic smelly rooms and worst food ever.

Don not visit this hotel for your stay, it would be a nightmare for you. Beware of this hotel and specially the staff I think they all are abnormal which made them show this kind of unhuman behavior.

When it came to the decision of picking a venue for important functions during my marriage, and for hosting my guests travelling from different locations, ""The Sonnet"" was an easy first choice. 

The team from the Sonnet, led by their manager, Mr. Anup Kumar Bera, did a fantastic job of taking ownership for the entire event. All my guests, where very happy with the quality of the rooms, as well as the service. The setup for the events (tilak & engagement/sangeet) was very elegant, and completely managed by Anup & team. 

What was most helpful was that my family and I had to put minimal effort in terms of decision making, as Anup & team were extremely competent. All guests were thrilled with the lights, decor as well as the food, and had an excellent time. What was even more satisfying was the fact that the cost of all the arrangements was extremely easy on the pocket.

I would like to thank Anup & the entire Sonnet team for providing a seamless and extremely satisfying end-to-end experience to my family and all the guests who attended the functions.",Asish K,26-Feb-18,5
The Sonnet Jamshedpur,"We selected The Sonnet for 2 of our wedding functions , the Tilak and Sangeet. Both of them were held on the terrace . The decor , stage , lights , menu and everything else was managed entirely by Anup Bera and his team. We did not have to manage anything once they came into the picture. Anup and his team did a wonderful job of both planning and execution of both the events. Needless to say, all our guests went back completely satisfied and happy with the arrangements ! Anyone looking to get value for money and excellence - this is the place !!",sweta s,26-Feb-18,5
The Sonnet Jamshedpur,Hotel Sonnet is an average comfortable stay for the people who do are not with to be pampered like 5 star properties. The room size was smaller than the average though with necessary facilities. Hygiene is ok. But the only trouble is novice staff at reception counter. You can expect people fiddling with things and expect a remarkably good amount of time for check out.,vmohanv,16-Feb-18,3

Otherwise the stay was comfortable and food quality was up to mar",peacelover01,23-Jan-18,4
Natraj Hotel,"I had gone to attend a friends marriage. The hotel was very good. The Hotel room had plenty of wardrobes and drawers for storage. They also have a dining table and some chairs in the room. Hot water wasn't available quickly as you need to leave the tap gor almost 15 minutes, that's a lot of water getting wasted. The internet connectivity of the hotel was very good as all the rooms were connected properly. The restaurant at the hotel serves complimentary breakfast and they have a variety of items like Idli, Medu Vada, Poori Sabzi, Paratha with Curd, Bread Butter Jam, Omelette, Juice, Tea and Coffee. Feels good starting the day with such a heavy breakfast.... Also, the Staff was very curteous and polite. Despite of the kitchen being closed after 10 pm the room service attendant arranged to give us Onion and green salad. That's quiet remarkable.",abbys777,5-Apr-18,4

Hotel Castle,"My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Castle in Jamshedpur for one night and it was a disappointing experience. There were used towels and soaps still lying in the bathroom. We had to ask for fresh towels and soaps which came after two reminders. Toilet rolls were missing and were never delivered despite two reminders. Room, though small, were clean. Overall, it looked like a case of lack of supervision. Staff were friendly and the location is good. With a little attention to details and proper supervision, this can be a good place to stay.",nrSrinivasan,23-Mar-17,2
Hotel Castle,The look of the rooms and stuff looks ancient but full marks for the neatness maintained in the premises. The staff are very polite and I really wantd to meet the owner and interact with him and even congratulate him on the superb maintenance but sadly that didn't happen. Very refreshing after a bad experience at another Jamshedpur hotel.,Rohitflies,30-Nov-16,4

Pal Comforts,Stayed for the first time as the place where I normally stay was fully booked. Rooms are good with ok interiors and nice fitting but food was just too average. The complimentary breakfast too was just too plain. Stay here if you can go out and eat.,upsingh2k,3-Feb-17,3
